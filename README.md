## About Learn Russian

Learn Russian is aimed at one of many subsequent projects that will aid in learning a language. Some of the planned features are

- Personal Dictionary - users will be able to add words to their private dictionary
- Reading Mode - users can tap on any word and it will show the meanings and relevant information
- Use of wiktionary, wikipedia and wikibooks for vast learning material
- Exercises just like in a classroom as opposed to toy exercises
- Use of modern NLP technologies to make it closer to a human teacher

As of now it is in its infancy. I am actually trying out the laravel framework.
